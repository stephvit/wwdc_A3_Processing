Title: Art through Processing - Gradient Radial ColourWheels 

Aim: the aim of the project was to create a art visualisation that is interactive for users. I designed a radial pattern that involved 5 circles which changed colour at randomised times when the code is run. I also made the code create a zoom in on the circles and then change colour and speed again.
